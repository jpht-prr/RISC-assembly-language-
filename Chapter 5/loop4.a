Understand the loop. Chapter 5 in the textbook.

## Question:
## Swap each pair of elements in the string "chararray"
## and print the resulting string.
## There will always be an evennumber of charcters.
##
## Output format must be:
## "badcfe"

#----------------- start cut ---------------------------------------------

    la $t2, chararray               # $t2 prints to the chararray
                li $t1, 0                       # $t1 holds the count

loop:           lb $t0, ($t2)                   # get a byte from the chararray
                beqz $t0, endChararray          # zero means end of chararray, or if chararray
== 0, then it's done
                beqz $t1, nota                  # current flag = 0 i.e.convert to uppercase
                bnez $t1, nota1                 # current flag = 1 i.e convert to lowerscase
#### That's odd, the problem doesn't ask you to convert between upper
and lower case.
                j loop                          # go round the loop again


nota:           add $t3, $t0, 1                 # convert the current chararray to uppercase
##### to do this you would have to or with 0x20 as 'A' = 0x41 and 'a' = 0x61
                sb $t3, ($t2)                   # store the converted chararray to the original chararray
                                                # (write the value from the register to the to the string in memory)
                li $t1, 1                       # flip the flag
                add $t2, $t2, 1                 # move pointer one character
                j loop                          # go round the loop again

nota1:          add $t3, $t0, -1                # convert the current chararray to lowercase
                sb $t3, ($t2)                   # store the converted chararray to the original chararray
                                                # (write the value from the register to the new string memory)
                li $t1, 0                       # flip the flag
#####this comment is a total mystery.
                add $t2, $t2, 1                 # move pointer one character
                j loop                          # go round the loop again

endChararray:   la $a0, chararray
                li $v0, 4
                syscall                         # prinnt

                syscall

                li $v0, 10                      # exit program service
