Understand the loop, chapter five of the textbook, loop6.a

## Question:
## "numbers" is an array of five words.
## Calculate the sum of all elements in "numbers"
## whose value is less than 1000.

----------------- start cut ---------------------------------

     la $t0, numbers
        li $t1, 5               # counter
        li $t2, 0               # sum

loop:
        lw $t3, ($t0)           # load word from away
        bgt $t3, 1000, process  # if value is 1000, dont add to sum
        beq $t3, 1000, process
#### the one instruction  bge  would do. Reason: to skip the add ########
        add $t2, $t2, $t3       # add to sum


process:                        # increment the pointer, get the next element of the array,
and decrement the printer
        add $t0, $t0, 4
        sub $t1,$t1, 1
        beqz $t1, done          # if counter = 0, then it is done
        j loop
